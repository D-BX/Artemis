# Artemis

## Inspiration
Our project was inspired by HackTX's own theme and the recent Mid-Autumn Festival, a celebration of successful harvests and fortune. The project's name is based on the Greek goddess of the moon, Artemis, establishing a celestial and aspirational theme. To create a supportive user experience, the platform features personal finance assistants represented by animals associated with moon goddesses across different cultures. We ultimately chose the Jade Rabbit, also known as the Moon Rabbit, as our main mascot because of its prominent portrayal as the companion of the Chinese moon goddess, Chang’e. This thematic choice frames the often-intimidating world of personal finance in a way that feels imaginative and engaging.

## What it does
Our project is a comprehensive financial assistant designed to simplify personal finance management. It is engineered to track detailed financial information, offering a clear and categorized view of a user's spending profile. It can also scan and organize complex credit reports, providing a legible breakdown of credit health. Crucially, it offers personalized insights derived from analyzing spending behavior and statement data, moving beyond simple tracking to deliver actionable, data-driven recommendations. To keep user engagement, the platform integrates gamification elements, using interactive games and collectible items to keep users motivated and actively working toward their financial goals. By blending essential financial literacy tools with these interactive elements, the platform makes budgeting and saving fun and approachable.

## How we built it
We utilized a modern, decoupled tech stack to build Artemis. For the front end, we employed Next.js, a powerful React framework, ensuring high performance and server-side rendering capabilities, complemented by Tailwind CSS for efficient utility-first styling and a responsive interface. We utilized Flask, a lightweight Python web framework, to handle the backend services, managing API endpoints and business logic. For the core intelligence, we implemented an XGBoost model, a highly efficient and scalable gradient boosting framework, to accurately predict credit risk based on user data. A key innovation was the integration of SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values and Explainable AI (XAI) methods. This allows us to interpret the complex model's predictions, providing users with a transparent explanation of why certain financial outcomes or recommendations were generated, fostering trust and understanding.

## Challenges we ran into
We faced several significant challenges throughout the development process. Initially, a major hurdle was the conceptual brainstorming of how to organically merge sophisticated financial tracking tools with an interactive, compelling game-like experience without compromising utility. We also encountered technical difficulties integrating our machine learning model with the frontend interface, specifically ensuring reliable API communication and efficient data transfer between the Flask backend and the Next.js frontend. Furthermore, properly cleaning, formatting, and standardizing diverse financial statement data for the XGBoost model to process accurately proved to be a complex, data-engineering challenge. Finally, balancing comprehensive functionality with a polished visual design within the accelerated time constraints of the hackathon required disciplined project management.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We’re proud of creating a fully functional prototype that successfully combines financial tracking, machine learning expandability, and gamification within a unified experience. Our integration of XAI through SHAP values adds transparency to credit risk predictions — something rarely seen in hackathon projects. We also take pride in the creative concept and visual design, especially the mascot and themed interface inspired by moon mythology.

## What we learned
The project provided invaluable learning experiences across the entire development spectrum. We learned how to collaborate effectively across specialized domains, including frontend development, backend architecture, and data science, all while working under the intense pressure of a time-boxed environment. Our team gained deep, hands-on experience in the complex process of integrating a machine learning model into a functional web stack, visualizing its decisions, and abstracting those decisions for a lay audience. We also significantly improved our understanding of how to make financial education more accessible and engaging through a focused, user-centric design approach. Finally, we learned the critical skill of scoping features realistically and developing quick, effective technical adaptations when unforeseen challenges arose.

## What's next for Artemis
We have ambitious plans to evolve Artemis into a more robust financial companion. We plan to expand the gacha system with a wider variety of characters and collectibles and introduce additional minigames specifically designed to reward and reinforce good spending habits. We will also improve the credit insights dashboard with richer data visualization and more granular, interactive health metrics. In the future, we hope to incorporate real-time transaction syncing with financial institutions and build more sophisticated, robust financial goal tracking mechanisms. Ultimately, these expansions will make Artemis not just a game, but a truly trusted, interactive, and intelligent companion for building smarter financial habits.
